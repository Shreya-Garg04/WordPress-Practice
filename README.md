# WordPress Learning

I am currently starting to explore WordPress to understand:
- How WordPress themes and plugins work
- The role of PHP, HTML, and MySQL in it
- How to contribute to open-source WordPress projects

I don’t know anything about WordPress yet, but I’m starting with official documentation and tutorials.
